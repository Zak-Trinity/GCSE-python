#Inputs explained
#Input is a function
#It allows a user to input data into a program via a keyboard
#It can also display strings.

#Here is a variable
name = "zak"
#here is a variable with input
name = input("Enter name: ")
#This will display "enter name: "
#The user should then enter a string then press enter
#The data entered will be stored in the variable

#This data can be displayed later
print(name)

#Here is an example program:

user_name = input("What is your name? ")
age = int(input("What is your age? "))
fav_colour = input("What is your favourite colour? ")
print(f"Your name is {name}, you are {age} years old and your favourite colour is {fav_colour}")
