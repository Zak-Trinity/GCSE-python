#Casting introduced
#Casting is a way to change data types
#example:

age = int(input("enter age: "))
total = age+10
print(total)

#or you could do
age_two = input("enter an age")
age_two_int = int(age_two)
total_two = age_two + 10
print(total_two)

#The following functions allow you to cast
int()
str()
float()
